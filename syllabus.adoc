This course covers the engineering and design of IT infrastructure, focusing on cloud-scale distributed
systems and modern DevOps practices. IT infrastructure deployment practices are rapidly changing as organizations build
infrastructure as code and adopt cloud computing platforms. 

We will examine the theory behind these modern practices and the real-world implementation challenges faced by IT organizations.

While the lessons will cover a number of theoretical concepts, we will primarily learn by doing.

No textbooks are required for this course. But you can read the books attached to the books section of this repo.

It's not possible to teach Linux in a handful of videos. If you
have never used Linux before, and you want to learn more you will need to invest extra time 
getting comfortable with the operating system. There are
plenty of free Linux training videos on the Internet and I strongly encourage you
to check these out if you lack Linux experience. For example, here is a free online
course you can take:

If you have access to LinkedIn Learning, you can check out the following class:

By completing the required course assignments you will gain basic Linux system administration skills.
