DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure (SEIS 615) Curriculum for Hannah King
===================================================================

Course Description
------------------

This course covers the engineering and design of IT infrastructure, focusing on
cloud-scale distributed systems and modern DevOps practices. IT
infrastructure deployment practices are rapidly changing as organizations build
infrastructure as code and adopt cloud computing platforms. We will examine
the theory behind these modern practices and the real-world implementation
challenges faced by IT organizations.

Objectives
----------

*   Understand how IT organizations are deploying modern infrastructure and
how to build infrastructure as code.

*   Understand how to architect cloud-scale distributed systems and the key
design patterns used to enhance scalability and reliability within these
systems.

*   Develop specific skills related to DevOps practices including source
control management, package management,
and configuration management.
